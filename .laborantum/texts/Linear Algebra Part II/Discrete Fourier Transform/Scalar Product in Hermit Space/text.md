# Scalar Product in Hermit Space

For the following vector pairs, find:

1. Norms of each vector
2. Scalar product between the vectors
3. Cosine similarity between the vectors

Vector pairs:

1. $\mathbf{u} = [1, 2, 3], \mathbf{v} = [1, -2, 3]$
2. $\mathbf{u} = [i, 2i, 3i], \mathbf{v} = [i, -2i, 3i]$
3. $\mathbf{u} = [1 + i, 1-i, 1 + 2i]^T, \mathbf{v} = [i, i, i]^T$
