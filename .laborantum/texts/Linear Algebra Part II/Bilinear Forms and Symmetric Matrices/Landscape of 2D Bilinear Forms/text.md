# 2D Bilinear Forms Visualization

You are given a $2 \times 2$ symmetric matrix $A$ through its eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

For 2 dimentional grid with 100 points in interval $\left[-1, 1\right]^2$, build a `contour` plot
of bilinear form value $f(\mathbf x) = \mathbf x^T A \mathbf x$.

Plot eigen vectors.

Find matrices $Q$ and $\Lambda$ such that the contours
of level sets are ellipses which axes that coinside with
diagonals with $45\degree$ and $-45\degree$ and

1. $f(1, 1) = 1$
2. $f(-1, 1) = 5$

How the level set will look like if one of the eigen values is negative?

How the level set will look like if one of the eigen values is zero?

How to make level set circular?

How the directions of the ellipsoids are related to the eigen vectors? Can you prove that?

How the size of the ellipsoids are related to the eigen vectors? Can you prove that?
