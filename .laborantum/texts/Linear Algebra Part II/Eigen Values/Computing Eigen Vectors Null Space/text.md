# Computing Eigen Vectors: Null Space

QR iteration gives you the eigen values, but does not yield eigen vectors.

You are given a matrix $A$ and its eigen values $\lambda$. Find corresponding eigen vectors $\mathbf x$:

$$A \mathbf x = \lambda \mathbf x$$

Resulting eigen vectors should be represented as a matrix, normalized and first coordinate should be nonegative. 

After that, the vectors should be sorted in descending order of the first coordinate.
