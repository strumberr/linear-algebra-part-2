# Finding Eigen Values

Write an algorithm that calculates eigen values of matrix $A$ using QR iterations..

To check the convergence of the algorithm, check that all elements below diagonal are equal to zero. Plot the maximal deviation of lower triangle matrix from zero throughout this process.

How many iterations of this algorithm do you need to perform to get a good approximation of Schur form?

Does it anyhow depend on $N$?

What is your theory, what is the assymptotics of convergence of this algorithm?
