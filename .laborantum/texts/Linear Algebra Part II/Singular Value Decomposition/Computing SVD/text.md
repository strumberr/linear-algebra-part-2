# Computing SVD

Write a program that computes SVD for a given matrix

The function should return:

* $A^T A$
* $A A^T$
* matrix $\Sigma$
* matrix $U$
* matrix $V^T$

You can check yourself: matrix $\Sigma$, $U$ and $V^T$ should recombine into $A$.

Singular values should be ordered in descending order and the first cooridnate of $V$ vectors should be positive. Pay attention to the signs of the first coordinate of the vectors in $U$.
